Although my experience in this animation technique is still somewhat limited, I am actively experimenting with it. Stop-motion, in my view, can be exceptionally diverse - sometimes very simple, yet other times utterly magical. I also really enjoy animating with my hands, even though it demands incredible persistence and a degree of humility. Sometimes, however, new and unexpected solutions can be born from the resistance of the material",
