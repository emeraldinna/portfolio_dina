This internship later became a work contract, during which I contributed to both Shelter 3 and a new game Meadow. I created keyframe animations for elephants and elephant babies, including a full set of emotional reactions, and animations for crocodiles and buffaloes for Shelter 3. Then, I worked on introducing elephant babies in the game Meadow. All animations were made in Motion Builder.",

Stop-motion, in my view, can be exceptionally diverse - sometimes very simple, yet other times utterly magical. I also really enjoy animating with my hands, even though it demands incredible persistence and a degree of humility. Sometimes, however, new and unexpected solutions can be born from the resistance of the material",
